# Lua Onboarding (Social)

**Congrats!** If you are reading this, you have already completed the first step of this guide:

- [x] Create a github account and join the Roblox organization

The rest of this guide will walk you through the Roblox Luau workflow. You'll learn how to create your own project, import dependencies, create a storybook, and run tests!

## Reference Guides
Before we continue, now may be a good time to brush up on some [Lua fundamentals](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/) and bookmark our [Luau spec](https://roblox.github.io/luau/) and [Roblox API Reference](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference) for safe keeping.

To get started, let's first **[fork](https://github.com/Roblox/lua-onboarding-social/generate)** and **clone** this repository:
