# Stateful components
[<< Previous (Creating our own story)](4.creating-our-own-story.md) | [(Testing our story) Next >>](6.testing-our-story.md)

Eventually we will need to have a component that can store and react to its own internal state. To facilitate this need, we can create a stateful component instead of using a functional component.

> :information_source: There was once a time where our version of Roact did not have hooks. Most production code at Roblox was written during this period of time. This means you'll more than likely run into many stateful components, despite best practices recommending otherwise. For this example, we'll practice writing a stateful component to better prepare for your future work.

Let's create a new story file in the `UI` folder and name it something like `counter.story.lua` to create a simple counter.

First let's import Roact:

```lua
-- counter.story.lua
local Packages = script:FindFirstAncestor("Packages")
local Roact = require(Packages.Roact)
```

Though instead of returning a function like we did previously, let's return a Component class:

```lua
--...
local Counter = Roact.Component:extend("Counter")

return Counter
```

If you've navigated to the story using the storybook viewer, you'll notice that the viewport is displaying an error stating that we're missing a `render` method. Adding a stub for the render method should address this error:

```lua
--...
local Counter = Roact.Component:extend("Counter")

function Counter:render()
	return nil
end

return Counter
```

Like before, returning nil for our component will simply not render the node, but this won't work for our counter! Instead we're going to need a `TextLabel` that displays our current count and a `TextButton` that increments that count. Let's first define these components as a fragment:

```lua
--...
function Counter:render()
	return Roact.createFragment({
		layout = Roact.createElement("UIListLayout", {
			SortOrder = Enum.SortOrder.LayoutOrder,
		}),
		countLabel = Roact.createElement("TextLabel", {
			Text = "Current count: " .. 0,
			Size = UDim2.fromOffset(200, 32),
			LayoutOrder = 1,
		}),
		countButton = Roact.createElement("TextButton", {
			Text = "Increment +1",
			Size = UDim2.fromOffset(100, 32),
			LayoutOrder = 2,
		}),
	})
end
--...
```

> :information_source: `UIListLayout`s have a `SortOrder` property which can define how it's siblings should be sorted. When set to `Enum.SortOrder.LayoutOrder`, it will sort it's siblings by the order of each of their `LayoutOrder` properties.

Great! Our Counter is starting to take shape, but we still have to figure out how to handle the internal state of the counter. We will need to increment the count by `1` every time we click on the countButton. We will also need to initialize our state so that our first click can have something to increment from.

Let's first tackle our initial state. Stateful Roact components have a lifecycle and we currently want to make sure we set our count to `0` when we initialize. So let's define our `init` function like so:

```lua
--...
local Counter = Roact.Component:extend("Counter")

function Counter:init()
	self.state = {
		count = 0,
	}
end
---...
```

Now that we've defined our state's structure, we can start listening to it in our render method:

```lua
--...
countLabel = Roact.createElement("TextLabel", {
	Text = "Current count: " .. self.state.count,
--...
```

Lastly, we'll need a way to increment our state when we click on the button. Using the `setState` method provided to us from the Component makes this a breeze:

```lua
--...
countButton = Roact.createElement("TextButton", {
	--...
	[Roact.Event.Activated] = function()
		self:setState({
			count = self.state.count + 1,
		})
	end,
}),
--...
```

Bingo-bango, there you have it! When we click on our button in our storybook viewer, we should see that our counter increases! Next we'll [write a test for our new story](6.testing-our-story.md).

Below is the full source of the `counter.story.lua` file:

```lua
local Packages = script:FindFirstAncestor("Packages")
local Roact = require(Packages.Roact)

local Counter = Roact.Component:extend("Counter")

function Counter:init()
	self.state = {
		count = 0,
	}
end

function Counter:render()
	return Roact.createFragment({
		layout = Roact.createElement("UIListLayout", {
			SortOrder = Enum.SortOrder.LayoutOrder,
		}),
		countLabel = Roact.createElement("TextLabel", {
			Text = "Current count: " .. self.state.count,
			Size = UDim2.fromOffset(200, 32),
			LayoutOrder = 1,
		}),
		countButton = Roact.createElement("TextButton", {
			Text = "Increment +1",
			Size = UDim2.fromOffset(100, 32),
			LayoutOrder = 2,
			[Roact.Event.Activated] = function()
				self:setState({
					count = self.state.count + 1,
				})
			end,
		}),
	})
end

return Counter
```
