# Installing tools and running tests
[<< Previous (Start)](/docs/index.md) | [(Writing some Luau) Next >>](2.writing-some-luau.md)

Before we can actually write and run some Luau, we'll first need to initialize our workstation.

## Recommended Internal VSCode Extensions
If you're using VSCode, we'd recommend installing the following extensions to start out with.

- [ ] [Download the latest rbx-aged-vscode .vsix release](https://github.com/Roblox/rbx-aged-tool/releases)
- [ ] [Download the latest vscode-rbx-lsp .vsix release](https://github.com/Roblox/vscode-rbx-lsp/releases)
- [ ] [Download the latest vscode-rbx-lrdb .vsix release](https://github.com/Roblox/vscode-rbx-lrdb/releases)
- [ ] [Install Stylua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.stylua)
- [ ] [Install Selene](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Kampfkarren.selene-vscode)

## Installing Foreman

Foreman is a toolchain manager that we use to install and manage other tools.

- [ ] [Install Foreman](https://github.com/roblox/foreman)

## Installing tools via Foreman
This repository uses a few command line tools, documented within the [`foreman.toml`](/foreman.toml) file. Some of these tools are internal to the Roblox org.

### Setting up a few more permissions
> :information_source: If you haven't already, [request to join the lua-apps team](https://github.com/orgs/Roblox/teams/lua-apps/members?query=membership:child-team).

Once you've joined, then [create a Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with Read permissions. Make sure you enable SSO for the Roblox org once it's created. You'll then pass this Personal Access Token to foreman using the following command:

```bash
foreman github-auth <token>
```

### Install step

To install these tools onto your path, run the following:

```bash
foreman install
```

Now that we've installed these tools, let's make sure everything went according to plan:

```bash
rotrieve --version
# rotriever x.x.x
```

*Note: If you are using M1 Mac and encountering issues with openssl, download the latest ARM version of rotriever from [the releases page](https://github.com/Roblox/rotriever/releases). Unzip the download, rename the unzipped binary to `rotriever`, make it executable with `chmod +x`, and place it in `~/.foreman/bin` to replace the version installed by foreman.*

## Using `lest`

This project has a few tests set up for us already. Let's see if we can get the Luau tests to run by running the bash script in our bin folder:

```bash
lest
```

:no_entry_sign: Uh oh, if I'm correct, you probably just saw an error that looked a little like this:
```bash
[all-tests] ERR Dev is not a valid member of Folder "LoadedCode.tests.Packages"
```

## Ro-trieving our packages
Fortunately all this error means is that we have yet to install our dependency Packages. We can use our rotrieve command to retrieve them like so:

```bash
rotrieve install
```

and then let's run our tests now:

```bash
lest
```

If everything went well, you should be able to see the following output:
```bash
# [all-tests] Running tests
# [all-tests] Hello from Luau!
# [all-tests] Test results:
# [all-tests]
# [all-tests] 1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped
# Lest report:
#  - all-tests .. succeeded
```
